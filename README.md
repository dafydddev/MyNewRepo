# Hello World

This is a repo for week 2 of the "Tools for Programming" course. 

There is an [updated file from another repo](https://github.com/dafydddev/MyNewRepo/blob/main/name.txt), which was accessed via [a link from the course](https://gitlab.utu.fi/tools-for-programming/week-2-exercise-1) before I set my own repo (this one) as the remote origin.

As well, I added [another file I stole from elsewhere](https://github.com/dafydddev/MyNewRepo/blob/main/git-sarjakuva.png).
